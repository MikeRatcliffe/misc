# Facebook Data Deletion Instructions


Bitquest.io gives you the option of logging in with Facebook. As part of their terms and conditions, we need to have this page explaining how to remove your login info from your Facebook account.

## To remove an app or website you've added:

1.  Click account in the top right of Facebook.
2.  Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.
3.  Go to the 'App or websites' that you want to remove, then next to the name of the app or website, click Remove.
4.  You may select these options:
    1.  Delete posts, videos or events bitquest.io posted on your timeline (we don't post on timelines).
    2.  Allow Facebook to notify bitquest.io that your login connection was removed. They may offer you another way to log in.
5.  Click Remove again to confirm.
