We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use.

### 2.6 Do Not Track Settings

Some web browsers have settings that enable you to request that we do not track your movement within our website. We do not obey such settings when transmitted to and detected by our website. However, this does not change our compliance in any other way with our Privacy Policy.
